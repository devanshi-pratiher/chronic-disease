# Advanced Data Mining Analysis on Chronic Disease Indicators Community Analysis

## Dataset taken from Division of Population Health Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Cancer and other chronic diseases have emerged as the leading causes of mortality and disability, exerting a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. The understanding of mortality trends and disparities associated with chronic diseases, particularly cancer, is crucial for public health initiatives and resource allocation. Therefore, collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and disseminating data on chronic diseases like cancer is vital to understanding and raising awareness about mortality and disparities. The Division of Population Health within the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed a comprehensive set of 124 indicators within the Chronic Disease Indicator (CDI) dataset that was developed by consensus which allows states and territories and large metropolitan areas to uniformly define, collect, and report chronic disease data that are important to public health practice and available for states, territories and large metropolitan areas. Considering these factors and its impact on individuals as well as healthcare industries, this project research focuses on community analysis for one of the chronic diseases - Cancer. This research uses data published by the CDC for detailed analysis. 
	In light of the substantial impact of cancer on individuals and the healthcare industry, this research focuses on community analysis within the realm of cancer research. By leveraging the rich dataset provided by the CDC, we aim to delve into the intricate details of cancer-related factors, such as location, disease duration, and mortality outcomes, to gain insights into the dynamics of cancer communities. The CDC's Chronic Disease Indicator dataset encompasses 43 columns, each representing specific information pertaining to cancer incidence and outcomes. These columns offer a nuanced view of the disease, considering different factors like location, duration of the disease, whether the disease caused mortality or not, etc. Considering these different parameters affecting the cancer, this research focused on detecting the different communities using different community detection algorithms.
By applying state-of-the-art community detection techniques, including Affiliation Graph Model, BigClam, Spectral Graph Partitioning, Girvan Newman, and Louvain, we seek to identify distinct communities within the cancer population. This analysis aims to shed light on factors closely associated with higher mortality rates among cancer patients. Understanding these communities and their unique characteristics will enable targeted resource allocation strategies, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes for individuals battling cancer. By employing advanced community detection algorithms, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that will inform strategic interventions and resource allocation efforts. Ultimately, this research seeks to contribute to the field by enhancing our understanding of cancer communities and facilitating more effective support systems for cancer patients.
We hypothesize that by applying community detection algorithms to analyze the social networks of individuals diagnosed with cancer, distinct communities will emerge, each exhibiting different levels of mortality incidence. Through this research, we aim to identify key factors that are closely associated with high mortality rates among cancer patients. Additionally, we seek to determine the critical communities within the cancer population that require targeted resource allocation in order to improve health outcomes.
